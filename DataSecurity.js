  -----------------data security------------------
  With the Salesforce platform’s flexible, layered sharing model, it’s easy to assign different data sets to different sets of users. You can balance security and convenience, reduce the risk of stolen or misused data
  
  - Organization
  For your whole org, you can maintain a list of authorized users, set password policies, and limit logins to certain hours and locations.

  - Objects
  Access to object-level data is the simplest thing to control. By setting permissions on a particular type of object, you can prevent a group of users from creating, viewing, editing, or deleting any records of that object

  - Fields
  You can restrict access to certain fields, even if a user has access to the object

  - Records
  You can allow particular users to view an object, but then restrict the individual object records they're allowed to see.
    - Organization-wide defaults
